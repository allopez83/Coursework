Coursework
====================

## Description

Various coursework from all current and previous courses at institutions I have attended. Usually comprised of Java, but other languages exist.

The institutions here include Foothill Community College, and San Jose State University.

Note that work is being done to transition from Eclipse to IntelliJ. Currently the entire Coursework repo is an Eclipse workspace. Later, IntelliJ will be used, probably with each course as an individual project.
