Emphasis on the programming portion

#??? - Final sequence may not be completely sorted due to cutoff, but it's ok, use insertion sort 

4.4,5,6, don't need to show intermediate step

4.7? Programming portion - it's just one program, with all the different algorithms
    Hint - start with only a few integers, and not all 100k integers. Only set it at the end.
    Generate the random numbers only one time, and pass into the different algorithms. Same input for all sorting methods. It's ok for there to be duplicate #s.
    Cannot call java library. Need to have your own complete code. Can be from open source, online, or whatever, but needs to be implemented in your program,
    Output result to screen right away after done sorting
    Also keep track of how long sorting takes
    Maintain counter keeping track of how many comparisons and swaps are done, and output them with a label
