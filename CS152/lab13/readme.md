NOTE: This lab will help with the next homework assignment.

For this lab, fix `graph.prolog` to avoid retracing steps.

Add a Visited variable to the `find_path` function.

Initially, `Visited` should be an empty list, but at each step, add the current node of the graph. Do not try any intermediary node if it has already been visited.
