Part 1)
Download test.bash. (Windows users may need Cygwin installed).

Before you run the program, write down your guess of what the output should be.

Now run the program.  Were you correct?  What is the issue?


Part 2)
Download object.racket.  Using closures and the box function,
implement the Employee constructor and the getters/setters
for each field of the object.

(You still may not directly use set!, but you may use the
set-val! function FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT ONLY.)

Are your getters and setters repetitive?
How could you improve the code to remove this repetition?
