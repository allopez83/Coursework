Implement the maxNum function.  This function reads in a list of numbers and returns the largest.
Define this function in a recursive manner.

Implement the "fizzbuzz" game.  The function counts from 1 to the specified number, returning a
string with the result.  The rules are:

    If a number is divisible by 3 and by 5, instead say "fizzbuzz"
    Else if a number is divisible by 3, instead say "fizz"
    Else if a number is divisible by 5, instead say "buzz"
    Otherwise say the number

Here is a sample run of this function:

*Main> fizzbuzz 15
"1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz"
