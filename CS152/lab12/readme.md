Today you will use Prolog to solve a murder mystery.

There are 5 victims:

1. Mr. Boddy, the host of the party.  Killed with a candlestick in the hall.
2. The cook.  Killed with a knife in the kitchen.
3. A motorist who stopped by the house.  Killed with a wrench in the lounge.
4. A police officer who was searching for the motorist.  Killed with a lead pipe in the library.
5. Yvette, the house maid.  Strangled by a rope in the billiards room.
6. A singing telegram.  Shot with the revolver in the hall.

The suspects are:

1. Professor Plum
2. Mrs. Peacock
3. Mrs. White
4. Miss Scarlet, a Madam operating a brothel in Washington DC.
5. Colonel Mustard
6. Mr. Green
7. Wadsworth, the butler

You are given the following clues regarding motive:

- Everyone except Wadsworth had a motive to kill Mr. Boddy.
- The cook had worked for Mrs. Peacock, and had stolen money from her.
- The motorist was blackmailing Colonel Mustard.
- Yvette had worked for Miss Scarlet's brothel before, and left on bad terms.
- Yvette and Colonel Mustard had formerly had an affair, and she was threatening to tell his wife.
- Mrs. White knew that Yvette was also having an affair with her husband.
- Miss Scarlet had been bribing the police officer to keep him from arresting her.
- Professor Plum had lost his license as a psychiatrist after having an affair with his patient, who turns out to be the singing telegram.

There are some additional clues that may help you solve the case:

- Colonel Mustard is bad with knots, and so could not have used the rope.
- Professor Plum hates guns.
- Mrs. Peacock would never risk damaging a fine candlestick by using it as a weapon.
- Miss Scarlet was never in the billiards room.
- Professor Plum was never in the kitchen.
- Colonel Mustard never visited the room where Mr. Boddy was murdered.
- Mrs. White has an alibi for the murder of Mr. Boddy.
- Mr. Green has an alibi for every murder.
- Miss Scarlet has an alibi for every murder committed in the same room where the revolver was used.
