Project 1
======================

## Notes

- don't hold lock on log file
- VMMS.dll loaded in virtual memory

## First part

- Ensure shared memory works
- memset('X') to initialize memory with something, in this case, X-es
    - peek inside memory and should see the dummy data
- second instance of process should point to different memory
- stop a process using the system pause system call, or sleep() command
